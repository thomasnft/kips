## Simple Summary
A standard interface for composing Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) metadata.

## Abstract
This proposal aims to standardize the process of composing NFT metadata. We believe that innovatively composing NFT metadata will provide owners of NFTs with powerful tools to enhance the overall value of their NFTs.

For instance, consider a scenario in a racing game where a player purchases a car NFT. During an auction, the player acquires a uniquely lucky number for a license-plate NFT. With this proposed standard, the player would be able to compose the license-plate NFT with the car NFT, showcasing the lucky number in the game.

In another example, envision a player in a shooting game who purchases a character NFT. Upon successfully completing a mission, the player is rewarded with a highly powerful gun NFT. Through this proposed standard, the player can compose the powerful gun NFT with the character NFT, thereby boosting the capabilities of their character in the game.

## Motivation
Currently, there is no standardized way to compose NFT metadata. With the implementation of KIP-155, NFT owners will gain the ability to compose the metadata of their NFTs, thereby enhancing the overall value of these digital assets.

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Interface
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

/// @dev the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is `0x17e6e974`
interface IComposable {
  struct Token {
    // the collection address of NFT
    address collection;
    // the NFT token ID
    uint256 tokenId;
  }

  /**
    * @dev The registry MUST emit the Compose event upon successful composing data.
    */
  event Compose(address srcCollection, uint256 srcTokenId, address descCollection, uint256 descTokenId, bytes32[] keyNames);

  /**
    * @dev Compose metadata from source NFT to dest NFT.
    *   
    * Emits Compose event.
    * @param srcToken source NFT
    * @param descToken dest NFT
    * @param keyNames the key array to be composed from source to dest   
    * @return a boolean value indicates the composing is whether successful or not
    */
  function compose(Token calldata srcToken, Token calldata descToken, bytes32[] calldata keyNames) external returns (bool);
}
```

## Rationale

**Source and Destination NFT**

The defined metadata from source NFT can be composed to destination NFT. This opens up possibilities for dynamic content creation and customization within the non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem. This migration process empowers NFT owners to curate unique and personalized digital assets by combining or enhancing the metadata associated with their NFTs.

**Decompose**

The owner of NFT can decompose it to many smaller parts in terms of metadata. Decomposition allows for the disassembly of a complex, composite NFT into its individual components, each representing distinct elements or attributes associated with the original composition.

## Backwards Compatibility
This standard is fully compatible with KIP-17 (ERC-721) tokens.

## Test Cases
You can find test cases for this KIP, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/darenft-labs/protocol-v2/blob/main/test/DataRegistry.ts#L415).

  // ====================================================
  //                    COMPOSABLE
  // ====================================================
  function compose(Token calldata srcToken, Token calldata descToken, bytes32[] calldata keyNames) external returns (bool){
    require(IERC721(srcToken.collection).ownerOf(srcToken.tokenId) == _msgSender(), "Sender MUST be owner of source token");
    require(IERC721(descToken.collection).ownerOf(descToken.tokenId) == _msgSender(), "Sender MUST be owner of destination token");
    require(keyNames.length <= MAX_SIZE_KEYS_COMPOSED, "The keys array size MUST NOT exceed limit");

    require(srcToken.collection != address(this) && descToken.collection != address(this), "Derived token SHALL NOT be composable");

    uint j;
    while (j < keyNames.length) {
      _registry[descToken.collection][descToken.tokenId][keyNames[j]] = _registry[srcToken.collection][srcToken.tokenId][keyNames[j]];
      delete _registry[srcToken.collection][srcToken.tokenId][keyNames[j]];
      j++;
    }

    emit Compose(srcToken.collection, srcToken.tokenId, descToken.collection, descToken.tokenId, keyNames);

    return true;
  }

  // ====================================================
  //                    IERC165
  // ====================================================
  function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
    public
    view
    override (IERC165)
    returns (bool)
  {
    return 
      super.supportsInterface(interfaceId) ||
      interfaceId == 0x17e6e974 || // IComposable
  }
}
