## Simple Summary
A standard interface for inscribing immutable data for Non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

## Abstract
This proposal aims to standardize the process of inscribing immutable data for NFTs. We believe that inscribing data on-chain will significantly enhance the value of NFTs. Data inscribed on-chain ensures the permanence and immutability of the metadata, guaranteeing that essential information about the NFT remains intact and unaltered over time. This feature is pivotal for preserving the authenticity and provenance of digital assets, enhancing trust among users and collectors.

## Motivation
Currently, there is no standardized way to inscribe immutable data on NFTs. This proposal enables the inscription of NFT metadata in a low-cost manner.

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Interface
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

/// @dev the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is `0x5193025c`
interface IInscriptable {
  /**
    * @dev Inscribe metadata on NFT in terms of key/value.
    *       
    * @param collection collection address of the NFT
    * @param tokenId token ID of the NFT
    * @param key the Keccak256 hashed key
    * @param value the ABI encoded value
    */
  function inscribe(address collection, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 key, bytes calldata value) external;
}
```

## Rationale

**Calldata**

The inscription is sent via calldata, to save gas cost. Sending the inscription via calldata to save gas costs is a strategic approach to optimizing the efficiency of the data inscription process on the blockchain. Calldata, which refers to the input data passed to a smart contract function, is a cost-effective way to transmit information as it minimizes the computational resources required for transaction execution.

**Queryable via Indexer**

The inscription is queryable via an indexer. The indexer can listen to the transactions that occur on-chain, decode the function call parameters, and then store the inscribed data in its storage. These inscribed data can be queried through the indexer's engine, enabling all parties to look up the NFT's data.

**Writer roles**

Only the DApps are eligible to inscribe metadata of NFT to their registry. This ensures that the DApps are the parties responsible for the correctness and authenticity of the inscribed metadata on NFTs.

## Backwards Compatibility
This standard is fully compatible with [KIP-17](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-17.md) tokens.

## Test Cases
You can find test cases for this KIP, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/darenft-labs/protocol-v2/blob/main/test/DataRegistry.ts#L865).
