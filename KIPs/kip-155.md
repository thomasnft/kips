## Simple Summary
A standard interface for storing Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) metadata onchain.

## Abstract
This proposal aims to standardize the process of storing NFT metadata on-chain. We believe that storing NFT metadata on-chain is crucial for making NFTs true digital assets for several reasons.

Firstly, on-chain storage ensures the permanence and immutability of metadata, guaranteeing that essential information about the NFT remains intact and unaltered over time. This feature is pivotal for preserving the authenticity and provenance of digital assets, thereby enhancing trust among users and collectors.

Secondly, as an increasing number of NFTs represent dynamic digital assets in games, metaverses, and ecosystems, many of these NFTs evolve over time. For example, a character NFT in an online game may level up, increasing the value of the NFT. The accruing values of these assets need to be stored in an immutable, secured, and accessible place.

Moreover, on-chain metadata storage enhances the interoperability of NFTs across various platforms and applications. Decentralized applications (DApps), marketplaces, and smart contracts can seamlessly interact with NFTs when metadata is readily available on the blockchain. This interoperability fosters a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem, empowering developers to create innovative and diverse experiences for users.

## Motivation
Typically, NFT metadata is stored off-chain, either on an IPFS server or an HTTP server, introducing several issues. One of the primary concerns is the vulnerability of centralized servers or external databases where the metadata is typically stored. These centralized points of failure pose a risk of data loss, unauthorized access, or manipulation, compromising the integrity of NFT-related information.

Moreover, these off-chain solutions do not provide accessibility for DApps to leverage NFT metadata for business needs, inherently limiting the value of NFTs in digital spaces.

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Interface
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

/// @dev the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is `0xd212301b`
interface IDynamic {
  /**
    * @dev The registry MUST emit the Write event upon successful writing data.
    */
  event Write(address requester, address nftCollection, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 key, bytes value);

  /**
   * @dev Write metadata for an NFT in terms of key/value.
   *   
   * Emits Write event.
   * @param requester the owner of NFT
   * @param collection the collection address of NFT
   * @param tokenId the NFT token ID
   * @param key the Keccak256 hashed key
   * @param value the ABI encoded value
   */
  function safeWrite(address requester, address collection, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 key, bytes calldata value) external;

  /**
   * @dev Return the value corresponding to specific key of an NFT.
   *   
   * @param collection the collection address of NFT
   * @param tokenId the NFT token ID
   * @param key the Keccak256 hashed key
   * @return the ABI encoded value
   */
  function read(address nftCollection, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 key) external view returns (bytes memory);  
}
```

## Rationale

**Key/value schema**

The key-value schema is a fundamental data organization concept that underlies many data storage and retrieval systems. In this schema, data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key uniquely identifies a corresponding value. The rationale behind employing a key-value schema lies in its simplicity, efficiency, and versatility across various applications.

**Writer roles**

Only the DApps are eligible to write metadata of NFT to their registry. This ensures that the DApps are the parties responsible for the correctness and authenticity of the metadata on NFTs. All users of DApps should trust the metadata of NFTs stored on the DApps' data registry.

## Backwards Compatibility
This standard is fully compatible with KIP-17 (ERC-721) tokens.
