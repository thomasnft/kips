## Simple Summary
A standard interface for storing Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) metadata onchain.

## Abstract
> This proposal aim to standardize the process of storing NFT's metadata onchain. Currently, NFT's metadata is stored offchain, on a IPFS server or a HTTP server, which introduces several issues. One of the primary concerns is the vulnerability of centralized servers or external databases where the metadata is typically stored. These centralized points of failure pose a risk of data loss, unauthorized access, or manipulation, compromising the integrity of NFT-related information. Additionally, relying on off-chain storage can hinder the scalability and performance of decentralized applications (DApps) and NFT marketplaces. Accessing metadata from external sources may result in latency and slower response times, negatively affecting user experience and limiting the real-time functionality of blockchain applications. The technical challenges associated with storing NFT metadata off-chain highlight the importance of on-chain solutions. On-chain storage not only addresses these issues but also provides a more secure, transparent, and interoperable foundation for the evolving landscape of non-fungible tokens.
> Firstly, on-chain storage ensures the permanence and immutability of the metadata, guaranteeing that essential information about the NFT remains intact and unaltered over time. This feature is pivotal for preserving the authenticity and provenance of digital assets, enhancing trust among users and collectors.

> Secondly, on-chain storage facilitates decentralized access to NFT metadata. By keeping this information on the blockchain, it becomes universally accessible to anyone connected to the network. This inclusivity promotes transparency and eliminates the reliance on centralized servers or databases, reducing the risk of data manipulation or loss.

> Moreover, on-chain metadata storage enhances the interoperability of NFTs across various platforms and applications. Decentralized applications (DApps), marketplaces, and smart contracts can seamlessly interact with NFTs when metadata is readily available on the blockchain. This interoperability fosters a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem, empowering developers to create innovative and diverse experiences for users.

In summary, storing NFT metadata on-chain provides a foundation for trust, transparency, and interoperability within the blockchain space. It ensures the longevity of digital assets, decentralizes access to critical information, and fosters a more robust and interconnected NFT ecosystem.
