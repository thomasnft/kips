## Simple Summary
A standard interface for storing Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) metadata onchain.

## Abstract
This proposal aim to standardize the process of storing NFT's metadata onchain. We believe storing NFT's metadata onchain is the key to make NFTs trully digital assets, for some reasons.

Firstly, on-chain storage ensures the permanence and immutability of the metadata, guaranteeing that essential information about the NFT remains intact and unaltered over time. This feature is pivotal for preserving the authenticity and provenance of digital assets, enhancing trust among users and collectors.

Secondly, with more and more NFTs are issued to represent digital assets in games, metaverses, ecosystems, and overtime many of these NFTs are evolving, e.g. a character NFT in online game can level up, thus increase the value of NFT. These accruing values need to be stored in a immutable, secured, accessible place.

Moreover, on-chain metadata storage enhances the interoperability of NFTs across various platforms and applications. Decentralized applications (DApps), marketplaces, and smart contracts can seamlessly interact with NFTs when metadata is readily available on the blockchain. This interoperability fosters a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem, empowering developers to create innovative and diverse experiences for users.

## Motivation
Typically, NFT's metadata is stored offchain, on an IPFS server or an HTTP server, which introduces several issues. One of the primary concerns is the vulnerability of centralized servers or external databases where the metadata is typically stored. These centralized points of failure pose a risk of data loss, unauthorized access, or manipulation, compromising the integrity of NFT-related information.

Moreover, these offchain solution do not provide accessibility for Dapps to leverage NFT's metadata for business need, which inherently confine the value of NFT in digital spaces.

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Interface
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

/// @dev the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is `0xd212301b`
interface IDynamic {
  /**
    * @dev The registry MUST emit the Write event upon successful writing data.
    */
  event Write(address requester, address nftCollection, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 key, bytes value);

  /**
   * @dev Write metadata for an NFT in terms of key/value.
   *

   * @param collection the collection address of NFT
   * @param tokenId the NFT token ID
   * @param key the Keccak256 hashed key

   */
  function safeWrite(address requester, address collection, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 key, bytes calldata value) external;

  /**
   * @dev Return the value corresponding to specific key of an NFT.
   *   
   * @param collection the collection address of NFT
   * @param tokenId the NFT token ID
   * @param key the Keccak256 hashed key
   * @return the ABI encoded value
   */
  function read(address nftCollection, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 key) external view returns (bytes memory);  
}
```

## Rationale

**Key/value schema**

The key-value schema is a fundamental data organization concept that underlies many data storage and retrieval systems. In this schema, data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key uniquely identifies a corresponding value. The rationale behind employing a key-value schema lies in its simplicity, efficiency, and versatility across various applications.

## Backwards Compatibility
This standard is fully compatible with KIP-17 (ERC-721) tokens.

## Test Cases
You can find test cases for this KIP, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/darenft-labs/protocol-v2/blob/main/test/DataRegistry.ts#L174).
